## Overview
The Face Recognition for Student Attendance project is designed to automatically record attendance by recognizing students' faces as they enter the classroom. The system uses a pre-trained deep learning model to identify students and log their attendance in a secure database.

## Features
- **Automated Attendance Recording**: Recognizes students' faces and records their attendance automatically.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Provides instant feedback on student identification.
- **Database Integration**: Securely stores attendance records in a database.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for both administrators and students.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for admin panel)
- **Backend**: Flask/Django (for web-based applications)
